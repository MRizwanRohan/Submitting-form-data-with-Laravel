First we have to create view page. for that we have to go to == resources >> views >> "create a view file"
Then we have to create a form using html.
Now it's time to make a controller. I have created "registrationController"
Then we have to make public function in controller which will return the view page which contains the form.
After that we have to go tp web.php from routes and config the route.

everything is set. now we have to config the forms action to post method. and create another function in controller that will show us the data user have provided. 
Everything is done. Now run the program and fill the form and see how it works. Enjoy!!
